---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Welcome to the PyScript documentation!</p>

PyScript is a programming platform that allows you to create web applications that run in
the browser, using Python. That gives anyone the ability to program without infrastructure
barriers and creates some really interesting benefits:

* **Easy start**: create and share applications in the browser, not installation required
* **Simplicity**: Code your apps with a friendly and intuitive language like Python
* **Scalability**: since applications run directly in the browser and not on a server somewhere, servers don't need to
scale as much if the number of users of an application grows exponentially
* **Shareability**: applications can be shared as easily as sharing an URL. Can't get easier than that ;)
* **Multi-Platform**: since the browser is the underlying system where PyScript applications run, applications
can run anywhere a modern browser is installed, on windows, linux, mac, mobile, or even a Tesla! :)
* **Security**: since PyScript runs core in the Browser (via Web Assembly) in a sandbox fashion and the browsers offers
a very strict level of security, code never have access files or part of the underlying system without user permission,
making it a great option in terms of security.
* **User Friendly APIs**: web APIs are very vast and, sometimes, complicated. PyScript offers smaller and more user friendly
APIs for the most common use cases while also providing an option to access the full Web APIs as well.

We hope you'll enjoy the project and create so many incredible things with it! To learn more, consult our documentation.
