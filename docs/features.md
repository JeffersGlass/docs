# What is PyScript - Features

PyScript is a software platform that combines the power of the web with the power and simplicity
of the most popular programming language in the world to provide an ecosystem that let users create
and distribute applications in seconds, while having fun.


## How does it work?

The PyScript library provides HTML tags for embedding and executing Python code in your browser. PyScript is built using Pyodide, the WebAssembly port of CPython, which is compiled using Emscripten.

PyScript turns the browser into a code deployment tool that anyone can learn to use.

Example
In this example, we are using the <py-script> HTML tag to generate a Matplotlib figure and display it as an image. Click Preview to see the rendered HTML.

To try it in your browser, copy the code below into an online HTML editor like W3Schoolâ€™s Tryit Editor, which allows you to modify, run, and even save your code. Watch the video below to see it in action!
